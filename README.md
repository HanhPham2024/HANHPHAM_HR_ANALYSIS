This project is all about understanding and predicting career changes, which is an exciting challenge for HR departments.

# Objectives:
Identify key factors that influence career changes.
Build a predictive model to forecast career transitions.
Problem Statement:
HR departments need data-driven insights and tools to attract, retain, and manage talent in a fast-changing workforce environment.

# Solution:
We used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore and understand the data. You can access more details in the provided Colab links and the PowerPoint presentation.

We compared three models:

Logistic Regression
RandomForest Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Results: The Decision Tree Classifier performed the best, with an accuracy of 99.9973% for predicting career changes.

# Conclusion:
Employee analysis is crucial for HR decision-making. The key factors influencing career changes are:

Job satisfaction
Interest in changing careers
Salary
By focusing on these factors, HR can improve employee retention, maintain a stable workforce, and enhance performance. With these predictive models, HR can easily predict if an employee is likely to change careers and take appropriate actions.
