We implement some steps in exploratory the data (EDA) in order to gain the insights during the progress (click on the above link of colab as well as Power Point Presentation for more references).

There is 03 models in comparision: Logistic Model, RandomForest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier.
The result shown that decision Tree Classifier has the most accuracy with 99.9973% for predicting.

Employee analysis is significant for HRâ€™s decision making.
Main factors that affect to likely change career: Job Satisfaction, Career Change Interest, salary.
Focus above insights can retain employees, maintain work force, improve performance of employees.
From these models, HR easily predict whether an employee can be likely to change career and have suitable policy.
